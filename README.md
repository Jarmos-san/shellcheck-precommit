This is the **unofficial**
[pre-commit hook](https://pre-commit.com/#adding-pre-commit-plugins-to-your-project)
for [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/), the static analysis tool for
shell scripts.

**NOTE**: Here's the
[official](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck-precommit) pre-commit hook for
ShellCheck in case you prefer using that.

## üìú Usage Guide

Like any other [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hooks adding this specific
hook is as easy as configuring your project's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.
Simply add the following content to it & you're good to go!

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Jarmos-san/shellcheck-precommit
    rev: v0.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: shellcheck-system
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Difference Between the Official Hook

The official hook provided by the author of ShellCheck uses
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to build the tool. At the time of creating
this hook, I don't have Docker for certain unforeseen reasons. Hence, it's
necessary for me to use the tool when installed through a system package
manager.

That said, this hook will have Docker support as well in the future but not any
time soon.

TLDR: Use the official hook if you need explicit Docker support

## üéÜ Features To-Be-Added Later

This hook isn't complete yet & I would prefer it to be a one-stop solution for
all "_shellcheck_" requirements. As such following features will be added at
some point in time considering I continue to have the interest & availability of
time.

- Support both [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net) &
  [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh#shfmt) for the user to choose either
  one.
- Allow Docker support for both the tools of choice!
- Enable an option to build `shfmt` if the user wants to.

## üëã Supporting the Project

The project however small it maybe tries to adhere to the community's needs.
Hence, it wouldn't be in the position it is today, so feel free to support the
project.

That said, following are some ways you can support the project:

1. I don't always have to time iron out all irregularities of the project, so if
   you stumble across a bug or two, please feel free to either report or send a
   bug fix PR.
2. If the project helped you in any way or if you're using it to build a
   commercial project, consider sending a token appreciation (like a book or
   something).
3. Feel free to the star the project and/or share it with people you know will
   find it helpful. Spreading word about the project around the community is
   equally as helpful as the other tasks mentioned above.
